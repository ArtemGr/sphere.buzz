Buzz Sphere is a proximity chat that is still being developed.
I know that its web interface needs some love.
In order to simplify the process of making modifications to the web interface of Buzz Sphere
I've factored it out into a separate GitHub project, this project.

Making modifications to Buzz Sphere web interface is super easy, all we need is the usual combination of Apache and PHP.
Here's how you do this with Codeanywhere:

* Login to Codeanywhere at https://codeanywhere.com/editor/
* Navigate to File / New Connection / Git from URL. (Like on this [screenshot](http://prntscr.com/di0o15)).
* Enter the URL: "https://github.com/ArtemGr/sphere.buzz". ([Screenshot](http://prntscr.com/di0oxd)).
* Enter the name (Buzz Sphere), select the stack (PHP on Ubuntu). Hit "CREATE". ([Screenshot](http://prntscr.com/di0p50)).
* Wait for the new container to be created and deployed on Codeanywhere.
* Hit the "Run Project" button (which looks like your usual Play button) to see your own copy of the Buzz Sphere web interface.
* Start hacking.
